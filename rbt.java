// This is a binary search tree, whose nodes have the colour *Red* or *Black*
//
// - Every node is either red or black
// - The root node is black
// - If a node is red, it's children are all black
// - Every path from a given node to any of it's descendants contains
//   the same number of black nodes.

// Height h <= 2 log (n+1) where n is number of elements
